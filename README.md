# Simple Kanban

#### [https://todo.null.care](https://todo.null.care)

This is a super simple kanban app built with rust & sveltekit.
It features a personal kanban without having to create an account or register in any way.

 When you "log in" you get a random UID, you can also choose to "log in" with a custom user code. 
 *Note that this is not guaranteed to be unique so if you choose the code `1` chances are someone else might select it as well.*

> Todos are not private in any way other than locked behind the user code, so do not share any personal or sensitive information.
